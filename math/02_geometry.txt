LINES
distance = √( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ) 	// dist. is hypotenuse
mid_point = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)
slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)

slope of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals, eg.: 2/3 --> -3/2



ANGLES
acute <90°, right =90°, obtuse >90°, straight =180°
complementary (a+b=90°), supplementrary (a+b=180°)

if 2 lines intersect:
adjacent angles (next to each other)
vertical angles (opposite). are congruent

Transversal line - intersects 2 lines. if lines are parallel:

Any point that is on an angle bisector is equidistant from the sides of the angle  (and vise versa)

angle bisector, trisector - divides into equal angles



TRIANGLES
- right, acute, obtuse
- equilateral (3 equal sides), isosceles (2 equal sides), scalene (no equal sides)

sum of 2 shorter sides > longest side
sum of angles = 180° (proof through cont. lines into transversal)
Sum of angles in a polygon = (# of sides – 2) * 180°


the triangles are congruent if:
- all 3 sides are equal
- 2 sides and the angle btw them are equal 
- 2 angles and any side are equal
- in right triangle: hypotenuse and any leg

the triangles are similar if:
- 2 angles are equal
- all 3 sides are scaled by the same factor
- an angle is equal & 2 adjacent sides are scaled by the same factor


45-45-90
2b^2 = c^2
hypotenuse = leg*√2

30-60-90
short leg	long leg	hypotenuse
x		x*√3	2x
(if you adhere a mirrored triangle to this one you’ll get a 60-60-60 triangle hence the ratio)

Side splitting theorem: if DE || BC, then AD/DB = AE/EC

  /    \
B/______\C

medsegment of a tri is a side splitting line that splits sides into equal seqments
- each midsegment is 1/2 length of the side it is parallel to
- all 3 midsegments form a small inner tri dividing big tri into 4 similar triangles


Pythagorean Theorem
c^2 = a^2 + b^2

Pythagorean inequalities:
acute	c^2 < a^2 + b^2
right	c^2 = a^2 + b^2
obtuse	c^2 > a^2 + b^2

Perimeter of a triangle
for right tri we can use Pythagorean T to find any side. For oblique tri we can split it into 2 right triangles and then use Pythogorean T.


median - divides the opposite side into equal segments
centroid - cross-point of all 3 medians. It's allways 2/3 of the way from any angle.

In the physical world the centroid is also the triangle’s center of mass. If we throw it, the triangle will rotate around its centroid.
The 6 triangles acquired by dividing a triangle with medians have the same area
medial triangle - formed by connecting midpoints of each side of a triangle. The resulting 4 triangles are congruent to each other and similar to the “parent” triangle.

altitude - drops to opposite side at 90° angle
orthocenter - cross-point. It can be outside the triangle.
If orthocenter of a triangle == its centroid, then the triangle is equilateral

perpendicular bisector - perpendicular line that divides segment into 2 equal parts
any point on it is equidistant from the endpoints of the bisected segment (and vise versa)
circumcenter - cross-point. It can be outside the triangle. You can inscribe triangle inside a circle using this point (and vise versa)
circumcenter of a right triangle is the mid-point of the hypotenuse

In any triangle orthocenter, centroid and circumcenter all lie on the same line – Euler line.
Also the two segments formed by these points are equal.
Centroid is the origin of so-called 9-point circle

angle bisector - divides angle into 2 equal angles
any point on it is equidistant from the angle sides (and vise versa)
incenter - cross-point, can be used to inscribe circle


Area = 1/2 * base * height

Heron's formula:
s = 1/2 * (a + b + c)
Area = √( s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) )



QUADRILATERALS
angles sum up to 360°

- concave (angle that goes inside the shape)
- convex
	- kite
	- trapezoid
		- parallelogram
			- rhombus
			- rectangle
				- square
sqaure: 
	diagonal is a hypothenuse --> 
	d^2 = side^2 + side^2
	d = side * √2

parallelogram: 
	diagonals bisect each other
	Area = b * h

rhombus: 
	sum of 2 adjacent angles = 180°
	Area = 1/2 * d1 * d2

kite:
	Area = 1/2 * d1 * d2
		
Trapezoid: 
	scalene, right, isosceles
	  ____b1
	 /____\midsegment = 1/2 * (b1 + b2)
	/______\b2

	Area = 1/2 * h * (b1 + b2) 



POLYGONS
- convex
	angle sum = (n-2)*180°
	1 angle in regular poly = (n-2)*180°/2
	diagonal number = n*(n-3)/2
- concave



CIRCLES

Equation of a circle
    standard form: 	r^2 = (x - center_x)^2 + (y - center_y)^2 
					center and random point on circumference form right tri 
					with coord. origin (r is hypothenuse)	
					r^2 = x^2 + y^2 if circle centered at the origin

    general form:	x^2 + y^2 + ax + by + c = 0


	general --> standard:
	if x^2 or y^2 have coeficients, remove them dividing whole equation by this coef.
	(circle has equal coefs if it does have them)
	2x^2 + 4x + 2y^2 = 8 --> x^2 + 2x + y^2 = 4

	add (a/2)^2 and (b/2)^2 to the equation to get perfect squares
	(x^2 + ax + (a/2)^2) + (y^2 + by + (b/2)^2) = -c + (a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2
	(x^2 + 2x + 1) + (y^2 + 2*0 + (0/2)^2) = 4 + 1 + 0
	factor
	(x + 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2  = 5
	make sure the signes are "-":
	(x - (-1))^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 5
	center = (-1, 0), radius = √5


pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter:
pi = C/d = 3.1415926...
C = pi*d = 2*pi*r

Radius is perpendicular to its tangent line
Radius is perpendicular to a chord it bisects (and vice versa)


Arcs & Chords
measure: 	major, minor, semicircular (180°)
length:		angle/360° = length/(2*pi*r) --> length = m*pi*r/180

inscribed angle = 1/2 its central angle = 1/2 its arch
	=> inscribed angles with the same arch are congruent
	=> inscribed angles subtended by the diameter = 90° (the arch is 180°)
	=> if 2 chords are equal, their central angles are congruent (and vice versa)
	=> if 2 chords are equal, they are equidistant from the center (and vice versa)
	
verticle angles inside a circle = average of the 2 archs they create
a° = b° = (archA + archB)/2

Intersecting Chords Theorem:
If we have 2 chords AB and CD intersect at a random point X, 
then AX * XB = CX * XD


Intersecting Tangents and Secants
in any of the following 3 cases (see pic)
angle = (biggerInnerArch - smallerInnerArch)/2

1) 2 tangents
also: if you connect the angle vertex to the circle center, you'll get 2 congruent triangles!
	
2) 2 secants
also: outside1 * whole1 = outside2 * whole2

3) 1 tangent + 1 secant
also: tangent^2 = secantOutside * secantWhole
	

Triangle inscribed in a circle
circumcenter is a cross-point of perpendicular bisectors
	if acute triangle, its inside it
	if right tri - on hypothenuse
	if obtuse - outside

Tangent Chord Theorem (see pic)
If we draw a tangent line to an angle of inscribed triangle, 
the angle btw the tangent line and a chord = the angle opposite to the chord

Circle inscribed in a triangle
incenter is a cross-point of angle bisectors


Inscribed quadrilaterals
The opposite angles are supplementary (their sum = 180°)
=> the opposite angle = (360°-2x)/2 = 180°-x


Area
If we approximate circles as many rectangles, then we can unravel them and combine to halves into 1 rectangle. 
________
\/\/\/\/
 /\/\/\/\
Area of this rectangle = radius * 1/2 circumference -->
A = r * 1/2(2*pi*r) = pi*r^2

A = 1/4(pi*d^2)
A = C^2 / 4pi
A_sector = angle/360 * pi*r^2



TRANSFORMATIONS
- Rigid transformations
    • Translation 	
		T(x,y) = (x+a, y+b)
		Translation vector = (a, b)
			length(t.v.) = √(a^2 + b^2)
			slope(t.v.) = b/a
		
    • Rotation around origin
		90° 	CW 	T(x,y) = (y, -x)	CCW T(x,y) = (-y, x)
		180° 	CW 	T(x,y) = (-x, -y)	CCW T(x,y) = (-x, -y)
		270° 	CW 	T(x,y) = (-y, x)	CCW T(x,y) = (y, -x)
		
    • Reflection
    		y axis: T(x,y) = (-x, y)
    		x axis: T(x,y) = (x, -y)
    		y=x:	T(x,y) = (y, x)
    		y=-x: 	T(x,y) = (-y, -x)
    		y=x-4:	T(x,y) = (y+4, x-4)

- Non-rigid transformations
    • Dilations		
		center of dilation (origin)
		scaling factor = center_newV / center_oldV = new_side / old_side
			if scale factor is negative --> rotation 180°
