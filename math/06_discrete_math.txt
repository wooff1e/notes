SETS
cardinality     number of distinct elements of a set, 
                eg. A = {0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2} 	|A| = 4
power set       The set of all subsets of a set
tuple           an ordered collection, most common – ordered pairs (a1, a2)

Cardinality of Power set of a set with n elements is 2n
A = {0, 1, 2}
P(A) = {∅, {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}, {0,1,2}}
|P(A)| = 8

truth set of P is the set of elements x in D (domain) such that P(x) is true	{x∈D | P(x)}
D: 		    Z
P(x):       |x|=3
truth set:	{-3, 3}


Cartesian Product
A∙B = {(a,b) | a∈A, b∈B}
eg. A = {0,1} 	B = {2,3,4}
A∙B = {(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)}


Operations on sets
Union           A∪B = {x | x∈A ∨ x∈B}
Intersection    A∩B = {x | x∈A ∧ x∈B}
                If A∩B = ∅ then A and be are disjoint
Difference      A-B = {x | x∈A ∧ x∉B} = A∩Bc
Complement      Ac = {x∈U | x∉A} 
                the rest of the universe outside the set


Set Identities
Identity laws       A∪0 = A			        A∩U = A
Domination laws		A∪U = U			        A∩∅ = ∅
Idempotent laws		A∪A = A                 A∩A = A
Complementation law (Ac)c = A
Commutative law     A∪B = B∪A               A∩B = B∩A
Associative laws    A∪(B∪C) = (A∪B)∪C       A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C
Distributive laws   A∪(B∩C) = (A∪B)∩(A∪C)	A∩(B∪C) = (A∩B)∪(A∩C)
De Morgan’s laws    (A∪B)c = Ac∩Bc		    (A∩B)c = Ac∪Bc
Absorption laws		A∪(A∩B) = A			    A∩(A∪B) = A	
Complement laws		A∪Ac = U			    A∩Ac = ∅


Inclusion-Exclusion formula 
|A∪B| = |A|+|B|-|A∩B| 
(we add everything and substruct duplicates) 

for 3 sets:
|A∪B∪C| = |A|+|B|+|C| - (|A∩B|+|B∩C|+|C∩A|) + |A∩B∩C|



COMBINATORICS

Factorial notation:
5! = 5∙4∙3∙2∙1 = 120
0! = 1 (so that formulas also work for n=r)

a sequence of tasks/objects (we have n1 ways and one of n2 ways..), 
then total is n1*n2*n3 ... *nk 
    eg. a licence plate must begin with 3 letter and end with 3 digits, 
    count all possibilities: 26*26*26*10*10*10 = 17 576 000

If a task can be performed in one of n1 ways or one of n2 ways... 
and ther’s no overlap, then total is n1+n2+...+nk
    eg. I can travel to one of 37 international beaches or 14 domestic beaches, 
    i have 51 choices

if there’s an overlap, you need to remove the duplicates:
n1+n2+...+nk - n_duplicates		
|A∪B| = |A|+|B|-|A∩B|
    eg. How many bitstrings of length 7 either start with 1 or end with 000?
    1??????, ????000, 1???000
    2^6+2^4-2^3=72

if the opposite is easier to find: 
total count = sample space – opposite count 

if a task can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in n ways, 
and there are d corresponding outcomes per group, 
then there’re n!/d ways to do a task 
    eg. how many ways can i sit 6 ppl around a circular table where 2 seatings 
    are considered the same when each person has the same neighbours?
    6!/6


Permutations 
arrangement of n distinct objects where order matters
If we don’t have duplicates and we are not limited by number of spots (spots=objects)
number of permutations P(n) = n!

If spots are limited: 
nPr = n!/(n-r)!   # r is the number of spots. 
    eg. 3 ppl out of 10 winning 1st,2nd and 3rd prizes:
    10*9*8 to get this we take 10! and cancel out everything after 8: 
    10!/7! = 720

If some elements are the same, then we need to divide all permutations by duplicates of each kind:
n! / r1!*r2!...
    eg. permutations of "oobe" string: there are 24 options, 
    but only 12 of them (4!/2! = 12) are unique ("Oboe" = "obOe")


Combinations 
arrangement of n distinct objects where order doesn’t matter
(eg. COW, WOC, OCW are considered to be duplicates)
“n choose k”: nCk = C(n,k) = n! / r!(n-r)!
    eg. 3 ppl out of 20 winning the same prize: 
    C(20,3) = 20!/(3!17!) = 1140

Note:   C(n,0) = C(n,n) = 1     # n>=0
        C(n,1) = C(n,n-1) = n   # n>=1


Pigeonhole Principle
If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be 
at least 1 pigeonhole that has more than 1 pigeon in it.

N objects in k spots --> at least 1 spot containing ceiling(n/k) objects

Among 100 ppl, what is the number of ppl that must be born on the same month?
ceiling(100/12) = 9

How many balls must be selected from a bowl with 10 red and 10 yellow balls 
to ensure 3 balls of the same color?  
ceiling(N/2) = 3N = 5
There are 38 different time periods during which classes at a university can be scheduled. 
If there sre 677 different classes, how many different rooms will be needed? = 18
