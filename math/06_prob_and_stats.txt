Data
    - center
        - mean      = sum(data)/len(data)
        - median    = sorted_data[middle]
            (if len(data) is even, take the mean of 2 central elements)
        - mode      = element_with_max_count
        
    - spread
        - range     = max - min
        - interquartile range (IQR) = quartile_3 - quartile_1
            quartile_1 = median of the first half of the data
            quartile_2 = median of the data
            quartile_3 = median of the second half of the data
            quartile_4 = last_element
        - varience
        - standard deviation


Changing data
shifting (+constant):   change center but not spread
scaling:                change both

DATA DISTRIBUTION
            N   (whole population)      n   sample
mean        mu = sum(x) / N             x_bar = sum(x) / n
variance    sigma^2 = sum((x-mu)^2) / N   S^2 = (sum(x-x_bar)^2) / (n-1)
std dev.    sigma = √variance           S = √S

variance is basically mean of distances from the population's mean to each point squared 
squaring converts distance --> area,  which gives more weight to the bigger elements
(--> when minimizing variance, we minimize the effect of outliers)

for sample n in denominator gives us unreliable value, so we use (n-1) instead

Frequency histogram can be converted to frequency polygon (line connecting bar tops)
or dencity curve (frequency polygon smoothed out)
shading area under this curve gives uas % of the population
