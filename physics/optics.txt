Particle theory of light (1637 Descartes)

light reflected from the mirror: angles with respect to mirror's normal are equal bc. it takes least amount of time (Fermat)

Real / virtual images
real - reflected on surface and thus can be seen by everyone who can see the surface regardless of their position.
virtual - changes its "position" depending on viewer's position


CONCAVE MIRRORS
center of curvature - point where all normals meet

focal point - beams from far away that are || to the optical axis will be reflected into the same point

focal length - distance from focal point to the surface of the mirror, = 1/2 distance to the curvature center

circle mirror does not have a perfect focal point --> sphercal aberration

perfect curved mirror has a parabolic shape

numerous beams in all directions, we consider the easiest to use:
- || to optical axis
- intersecting the optical axis
- through the focal point
- through the center of curvature

Image:
- real
- inverted
- smaller

p=f case: reflected rays are ||, the image is infinitely large

CONVEX MIRRORS
scattering rays --> no real image, but virtual possible
extends our field of vision (or rather inverts it bc. we see backwards)

curvature center and focal point are behind the mirror


speed of light in vacuum = 299 792 458 m/sec

the more you move away the object, the closer image gets to the focal point and the smaller it gets

since the ray's angle is equal to the reflected angle, we get 2 pairs of similar straight tri:
# f = focal length, o = object, i = image, h = height, d = distance
oh / od = ih / id
oh / ih = od / id

oh / f = ih / (id - f)	
oh / ih = f / (id - f)

--> 
od / id = f / (id - f)
(id - f) / id = f / oh 
--> 
1 - f/id = f/od
1/f - 1/id = 1/od
1/f = 1/od + 1/id

	if object is placed at the focal point, then f = od  -->  
	1/f = 1/f + 1/id	--> 1/id = 0 	--> id = infinity

	if object is placed btw mirror focal point, f < od, 
	then 1/od > 1/f 	--> 1/id must be negative (virtual image)


Optical power
concave mirror collects all || beams in one point, you guide the light by placing several mirrors in a chain, each tilted in front of the previous mirror's focal point. 
1/f_total = sum(1/f_each) 

for convenience a new unit was invented to get rid of 1/*
diopter unit: 1dpt = 1m^-1
a 3-diopter lens brings parallel rays of light to focus at 1‚ÅÑ3 meter

optical power o = 1/f
o_total = sum(o_all)
